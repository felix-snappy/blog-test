# Atlas Ice launches newest product, the Chillaiz Ice Cup, designed by Snappymob & FOURDIGIT Malaysia


Atlas Ice is proud to announce the launch of its latest product, the Chillaiz ice cup, now available at emart24 stores across Klang Valley. The initial rollout included 10 locations, with Tamarind Square, Cyberjaya among the first to carry this new product.

This new product guarantees pure, high-quality ice anytime, anywhere—catering to the growing demand for on-the-go refreshment solutions.
